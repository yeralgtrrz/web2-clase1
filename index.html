        s changes have been measured in casesof increased difficulty,
        also referred to as cognitive load. For example,mice performing 
        an auditory categorization task, but not passively listen-ing mice, 
        show an increased population preference to frequencies nearthe category 
        boundary (31). Although these task designs tested increasedcomplexity, they 
        endure numerous levels of complications, both in thetask itself and in the brain 
        regions that they depend upon; perceptual dif-ficulty being just one. Thus, there 
        is a need for a simple and well-controlledtask that could isolate perceptual difficulty 
        from other task attributes.Sensory tasks that train animals to engage in gradually 
        more dif-ficult perceptual demands take days to weeks of practice. Conse-quently.
